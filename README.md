#Introduction

In this project we're exploring a dataset related to feline urinary obstruction (UO). The objective is to identify patterns and relationships in the data that can help answer key research questions concerning factors influencing UO procedure difficulty, recurrence, and post-treatment outcomes.
The dataset comprises 105 observations and 93 variables, including numerical and categorical attributes related to patient demographics, medical history, treatment procedures, and clinical outcomes. The primary goal of this analysis is to extract insights that can inform veterinary decision-making and improve patient care.

#Project Goals

To answer the following research questions:

1. Were overweight patients more likely to have another urinary obstruction than their healthy-weight counterparts?
2. Were patients with histories of urinary obstruction more likely to have a difficult procedure?
3. Were patients that experienced difficult procedures more likely to have another urinary obstruction?
