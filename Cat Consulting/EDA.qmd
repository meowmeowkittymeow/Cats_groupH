# FINDINGS:
#           1. Most of the cats who were treated for UOs are considered young (< 9). The median age of a treated cat was 4.75 years.
#           2. Half of the cats with easy procedures were between the ages of 3 and 7 years old.
#           3. Half of the cats with difficult procedures were between the ages of 3 and 8.8 years old.
#           4. The median ages for cats with easy and difficult procedures are very similar.

#           1. The median weight of a cat who got a UO procedure was 13.2 lbs.
